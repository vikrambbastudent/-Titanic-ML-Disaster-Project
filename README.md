# Titanic Machine Learning Disaster

This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing a large number of passengers and crew.

In this project, we use machine learning tools to analyze the passenger data (like age, gender, class, etc.) and predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains detailed information about passengers onboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

**Features**
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).

Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).

Name: Passenger's name.

Sex: Passenger's gender.

Age: Passenger's age.

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.

Ticket: Ticket number.

Fare: Passenger fare.

Cabin: Cabin number.

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes based on Titanic passenger data. It serves as a good introductory project for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.
